It acknowledges that banks have a crucial role to play in facilitating financing for sustainable projects and discouraging investments in projects that harm the environment and exacerbate climate change.\\n\\nThe text mentions the category of green bonds, which refers to financial instruments that are used to fund environmentally friendly projects. Green bonds have gained popularity in recent years as more investors look for sustainable investment options. Banks can play a key role in issuing green bonds and directing the proceeds towards sustainable projects.\\n\\nThe text also mentions the concept of 'no go projects', which means that banks have identified certain types of projects that they will not invest in. It specifically mentions two examples - Adani Carmichael coal mine and Keystone XL pipeline - which have been criticized for their negative impact on the environment and climate change.\\n\\nOverall, the text suggests that banks are increasingly aware of the need to adopt sustainable financing practices and are taking steps to align their lending and investment portfolios with environmental and social objectives. As a sustainability expert, I would encourage banks to further strengthen their ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies and practices to ensure that they contribute positively to sustainable development.\",\n"," '1 (Climate change and environment related)',\n"," '1 (Sustainability)',\n"," '1 (environment/sustainability/climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (environment related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (environment and climate change related)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change)',\n"," '1 (related to sustainability and water management)',\n"," '1 (The text is about reducing CO2 emissions and monitoring progress toward targets, which is related to sustainability, the environment, and climate change.)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (climate change and sustainability related)',\n"," '1 (climate-related risks and opportunities mentioned)',\n"," '1',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change and environment related)',\n"," '1 (sustainability and corporate socioenvironmental responsibility are mentioned)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (ESG expertise and low-carbon economy transition)',\n"," '1 (sustainability)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (Environment related)',\n"," '1 (climate change)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (environmental/ sustainability related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change)',\n"," '1 (sustainability)',\n"," '1 (sustainability and climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (environment related)',\n"," '1 (environment related)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (environment and sustainability related)',\n"," 'As a sustainability expert, I can see that AGL, the company mentioned in the text, is taking steps to address climate change by offering their customers an opportunity to offset their carbon emissions. The AGL Future Forests program provides a way for residential customers to offset the carbon emissions from their electricity consumption by purchasing native Australian forestry carbon credits. This is a positive step towards reducing carbon emissions, which is a key factor in the fight against climate change. Furthermore, the program also supports biodiversity conservation and the planting of Australian native trees, which is an additional positive outcome. The $1 per week cost is affordable for most households, meaning that it is accessible and inclusive. Additionally, the $1 per day electric vehicle charging offer further encourages sustainable mobility, which is a crucial component of carbon reduction and addressing climate change.

The scenarios developed by the IEA highlight the importance of policy interventions in shaping our energy markets and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Sustainable-Development Scenario is particularly important as it aligns with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting temperature rise to below 2°C, and with an even stronger aspirational target of limiting temperature rise to 1.5°C. This scenario also emphasizes the need for more sustainable development practices and technologies, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, as well as behavioral changes to support low-carbon lifestyles. Overall, it is important to recognize the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for immediate action to mitigate its impact.\",\n"," '1 (Environment-related)',\n"," '1 (sustainability

In some regions of the world, for example in West Africa south of the Sahara, raw materials for cement production are so scarce that cement or clinker needs to be imported by sea. Rising transportation costs and capacity constraints in the port facilities can lead to an increase in product costs. Overall, we rate this as a low risk.', 0], ['In light of such events there has been a rise in climate-change activism epitomised by Greta Thunberg. We have also witnessed a plethora of pledges from both companies and politicians to tackle climate change, but real, decisive action supporting the pledges to reduce emissions has yet to surface. The uncomfortable truth is that our entire economy is based on fossil fuels, and therefore moving to a low-carbon future will affect all sectors. Furthermore, having emitted the bulk of the emissions to achieve economic growth and raise living standards, the West finds itself in the Janus-faced position of asking the developing world to reduce their emissions and perhaps by extension limit their ability to deliver growth and lift people out of poverty.', 0], ['In 2017, I commissioned Newton’s first TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) report to ensure that we were holding ourselves to the same standards as our investee companies, and specifically to explain how we were considering, and preparing for, the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. Following the first report, I am delighted to introduce our second TCFD report which combines updates from 2018 and 2019, during which period we have made a number of positive changes. Highlights include establishing board-level oversight for Newton’s actions on climate-related risks, entering into new data relationships with carbon experts, undertaking significant internal education, and establishing a climate change-focused investment group to undertake climate scenario analysis.', 1], ['Whilst the transition scenarios saw material impacts on the investment portfolio, the most notable impacts on both investments and insurance liabilities arose from the physical effects of no transition, that is no additional actions beyond those already announced. Based on the PRA specifications, Scenario C, in which physical risk dominates, resulted in the most significant impact on the Group but did not breach risk appetite despite not allowing for reinsurance. This demonstrates the resilience of the Group’s strategy to such a scenario. Furthermore, the projected time frame (2100) for this scenario is likely to allow the business to adapt. The share of transition versus physical risks by scenario is shown below.', 0], ['We disseminate the importance of incorporating the sustainability principles in the planning and execution of actions to the entire value chain.

For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.27% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 8.5% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.3% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 6.8% expected return). For the international plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.1% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 4.8% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5.2% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10- year period ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 9.2%. For the international plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 7.0%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. Expected weighted average returns for international plans will vary.\", 0], ['Development of the Alberta oil sands has received considerable attention in recent public commentary on the subjects of environmental impact, climate change and GHG emissions.

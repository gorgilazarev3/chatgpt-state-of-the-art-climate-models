For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.27% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 8.5% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.3% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 6.8% expected return). For the international plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.1% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 4.8% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5.2% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10- year period ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 9.2%. For the international plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 7.0%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. Expected weighted average returns for international plans will vary.\", 0], ['Development of the Alberta oil sands has received considerable attention in recent public commentary on the subjects of environmental impact, climate change and GHG emissions.

On a semi-annual basis, the Risk Management department conducts a survey with all members of the Core Leadership Group (CLG), Extended Leadership Group (ELG) and Global High Potential Group (GHIPO) to ensure an effective bottom-up identification of risks and opportunities. Risk Management has also defined 25 categories to help identify risks and opportunities in a systematic way. In addition, adidas uses various instruments in the risk and opportunity identification process, such as primary qualitative and quantitative research including trend scouting and consumer surveys as well as feedback from our business partners and controlled space network. These efforts are supported by global market research and competitor analysis. Through this process, we seek to identify the markets, categories, consumer target groups and product styles which show most potential for future growth at a local and global level. Equally, our analysis focuses on those areas that are at risk of saturation or exposed to increased competition or changing consumer tastes. Furthermore, as part of our identification process, we monitor physical risks related to climate change as well as risks and opportunities resulting from the transition to a low-carbon economy.

The latest trend is related to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure TCFD. In other words, the trend is evaluating the financial values of non-financial information. The relevant companies would need to follow this trend and disclose related information faithfully. As corporate citizens that follow the UN SDGs, companies must perceive their roles and promote the relevant matters with an active mindset. Governance should be improved as well. In particular, LG Chem must disclose information transparently and establish a clear stance. Since LG Chem is the best and leading chemical company in Korea, its stakeholders will ask for flawless corporate management. LG Chem should feel proud and responsible at the same time because the society has great expectations for the company to meet the highest level of ESG regarding the rights of shareholders, safety and health of workers, health and privacy of consumers, and fair trading.

In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners. We utilize a broad distribution strategy which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the company’s sales in 2020. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and environmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers’ premises. To reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products, does not have a single-sourcing model.', 0], ['Development of the Alberta oil sands has received considerable attention in recent public commentary on the subjects of environmental impact, climate change and GHG emissions.

Furthermore, having emitted the bulk of the emissions to achieve economic growth and raise living standards, the West finds itself in the Janus-faced position of asking the developing world to reduce their emissions and perhaps by extension limit their ability to deliver growth and lift people out of poverty.', 0], ['In 2017, I commissioned Newton’s first TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) report to ensure that we were holding ourselves to the same standards as our investee companies, and specifically to explain how we were considering, and preparing for, the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. Following the first report, I am delighted to introduce our second TCFD report which combines updates from 2018 and 2019, during which period we have made a number of positive changes. Highlights include establishing board-level oversight for Newton’s actions on climate-related risks, entering into new data relationships with carbon experts, undertaking significant internal education, and establishing a climate change-focused investment group to undertake climate scenario analysis.', 1], ['Whilst the transition scenarios saw material impacts on the investment portfolio, the most notable impacts on both investments and insurance liabilities arose from the physical effects of no transition, that is no additional actions beyond those already announced. Based on the PRA specifications, Scenario C, in which physical risk dominates, resulted in the most significant impact on the Group but did not breach risk appetite despite not allowing for reinsurance. This demonstrates the resilience of the Group’s strategy to such a scenario. Furthermore, the projected time frame (2100) for this scenario is likely to allow the business to adapt. The share of transition versus physical risks by scenario is shown below.', 1], ['We disseminate the importance of incorporating the sustainability principles in the planning and execution of actions to the entire value chain.

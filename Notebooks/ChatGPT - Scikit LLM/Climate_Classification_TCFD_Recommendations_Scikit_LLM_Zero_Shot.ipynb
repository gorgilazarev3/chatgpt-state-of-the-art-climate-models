Constructing and managing mobility infrastructures means, above all, operating locally with the community and guaranteeing travellers a safe, quality service. The enhancement of human capital is therefore fundamental to all the company’s activities, and makes a significant contribution to guiding and characterising the entire operating process, from designing infrastructures to providing services to clients. For this reason, the company’s social responsibility is a circular process involving the three groups of stakeholders: the community, in the sense of the citizens, institutions and associations it is formed by; customers, to whom we offer our services, guaranteeing their safety and the safety of the infrastructures, and the supply chain. These three groups are linked to one another, with the stakeholder engagement model evolving all the time.', 0], ['What would be the critical ESG issues in the future, and what does LG Chem need to prepare? The latest trend is related to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure TCFD. In other words, the trend is evaluating the financial values of non-financial information. The relevant companies would need to follow this trend and disclose related information faithfully. As corporate citizens that follow the UN SDGs, companies must perceive their roles and promote the relevant matters with an active mindset. Governance should be improved as well. In particular, LG Chem must disclose information transparently and establish a clear stance. Since LG Chem is the best and leading chemical company in Korea, its stakeholders will ask for flawless corporate management. LG Chem should feel proud and responsible at the same time because the society has great expectations for the company to meet the highest level of ESG regarding the rights of shareholders, safety and health of workers, health and privacy of consumers, and fair trading. The recent safety accident was probably inevitable due to the business characteristics, but LG Chem should remediate the situation swiftly and systematically and come up with a solid measure to prevent recurrence. In this process, LG Chem needs to hear and reflect the opinions of the stakeholders through the active engagement of experts.', 2], ['In the past six years, our supervisory work and thematic reviews of CFD firms have found increasing instances of poor conduct and risks of consumer detriment across the sector. Our analysis of a representative sample of CFD client accounts found that these products were increasingly being sold to retail clients and that 82% of clients lost money on these products.

Overall, we rate this as a low risk.', 2], ['In light of such events there has been a rise in climate-change activism epitomised by Greta Thunberg. We have also witnessed a plethora of pledges from both companies and politicians to tackle climate change, but real, decisive action supporting the pledges to reduce emissions has yet to surface. The uncomfortable truth is that our entire economy is based on fossil fuels, and therefore moving to a low-carbon future will affect all sectors. Furthermore, having emitted the bulk of the emissions to achieve economic growth and raise living standards, the West finds itself in the Janus-faced position of asking the developing world to reduce their emissions and perhaps by extension limit their ability to deliver growth and lift people out of poverty.', 2], ['In 2017, I commissioned Newton’s first TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) report to ensure that we were holding ourselves to the same standards as our investee companies, and specifically to explain how we were considering, and preparing for, the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. Following the first report, I am delighted to introduce our second TCFD report which combines updates from 2018 and 2019, during which period we have made a number of positive changes. Highlights include establishing board-level oversight for Newton’s actions on climate-related risks, entering into new data relationships with carbon experts, undertaking significant internal education, and establishing a climate change-focused investment group to undertake climate scenario analysis.', 4], ['Whilst the transition scenarios saw material impacts on the investment portfolio, the most notable impacts on both investments and insurance liabilities arose from the physical effects of no transition, that is no additional actions beyond those already announced. Based on the PRA specifications, Scenario C, in which physical risk dominates, resulted in the most significant impact on the Group but did not breach risk appetite despite not allowing for reinsurance. This demonstrates the resilience of the Group’s strategy to such a scenario. Furthermore, the projected time frame (2100) for this scenario is likely to allow the business to adapt.

Additionally, a function that chains prompts was also created such that it receives the first prompt and forwards it as input in the second prompt.</h3>\n","<h3>In order to be able to run the scripts and the tasks, first the OpenAI key needs to be set.</h3>\n","<h3>Because this key is a secret and gives access to your OpenAI account, it should be hidden and not available in plain text to the public. It is advised to store these keys in files on your computer on on some cloud, like Google Drive where other people cannot access them and then open them in the Notebook and set the keys via variables, that way they can be protected from the public.</h3>\n","<h3>In our approach, we used text files on Google Drive to store the key and we open them in the Notebook, set the appropriate variable and then use the variable to set the key.</h3>\n","<hr>\n","<h3>To use this script, you need to set your OpenAI key, to do that, if you use the same approach as us, first you need to store your key in a file and store them on Google Drive and after that only the path to the file in which the key is stored needs to be changed and the script will work.</h3>\n","<h3>Alternative approaches include uploading your locally stored files to the Colab Notebook, using a GitHub repository or using alternative storage solutions.</h3>\n","<h3>On the following link you can find ways to deal with your files on various storage providers: <a href=\"https://neptune.ai/blog/google-colab-dealing-with-files\">https://neptune.ai/blog/google-colab-dealing-with-files</a></h3>\n","<hr>\n","<h3>Each task is structured in its own Colab Notebook and in order to get the results for a task, first the appropriate keys must be set in the Notebook and after that the whole Notebook can just be run and the results will be displayed at the end of the section, either by collapsing the section and running the cells from the whole section at once or running each cell one by one.

This relief was requested due to the formulaic approach of rate calculations under the AUC PBR (Performance-Based Regulation) mechanism, which would have resulted in significant rate increases passed onto end use customers. The current economic situation in Alberta, including the COVID-19 pandemic, were cited as reasons for the deferral.

The short-term nature of the business and the ability to re-price policies annually helps limit the impact of climate change on general insurance liabilities. This means that insurance companies can adjust their prices to reflect the impact of climate change on their policies.\\n2. Reinsurance arrangements help insurance companies mitigate risks associated with climate change. Reinsurance is a way for insurance companies to transfer some of their risks to other companies in exchange for a premium.\\n3. As climate change intensifies, the physical effects such as extreme weather events and rising sea levels could lead to more risks and perils that are either uninsurable or unaffordable.

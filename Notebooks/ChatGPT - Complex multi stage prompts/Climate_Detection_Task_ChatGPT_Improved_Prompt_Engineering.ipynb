Additionally, a function that chains prompts was also created such that it receives the first prompt and forwards it as input in the second prompt.</h3>\n","<h3>In order to be able to run the scripts and the tasks, first the OpenAI key needs to be set.</h3>\n","<h3>Because this key is a secret and gives access to your OpenAI account, it should be hidden and not available in plain text to the public. It is advised to store these keys in files on your computer on on some cloud, like Google Drive where other people cannot access them and then open them in the Notebook and set the keys via variables, that way they can be protected from the public.</h3>\n","<h3>In our approach, we used text files on Google Drive to store the key and we open them in the Notebook, set the appropriate variable and then use the variable to set the key.</h3>\n","<hr>\n","<h3>To use this script, you need to set your OpenAI key, to do that, if you use the same approach as us, first you need to store your key in a file and store them on Google Drive and after that only the path to the file in which the key is stored needs to be changed and the script will work.</h3>\n","<h3>Alternative approaches include uploading your locally stored files to the Colab Notebook, using a GitHub repository or using alternative storage solutions.</h3>\n","<h3>On the following link you can find ways to deal with your files on various storage providers: <a href=\"https://neptune.ai/blog/google-colab-dealing-with-files\">https://neptune.ai/blog/google-colab-dealing-with-files</a></h3>\n","<hr>\n","<h3>Each task is structured in its own Colab Notebook and in order to get the results for a task, first the appropriate keys must be set in the Notebook and after that the whole Notebook can just be run and the results will be displayed at the end of the section, either by collapsing the section and running the cells from the whole section at once or running each cell one by one.

As a sustainability expert, I would encourage banks to further strengthen their ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies and practices to ensure that they contribute positively to sustainable development. -1: 54 504 - 1 (Climate change and environment related) 1: 55 1327 - 1 (Sustainability) 1: 56 638 - 1 (environment/sustainability/climate change related) 1: 57 602 - 0 0: 58 414 - 1 (environment related) 1: 59 533 - 0 0: 60 559 - 1 (climate change related) 1: \n","61 471 - 1 (environment and climate change related) 1: 62 799 - 1 (climate change related) 1: 63 551 - 0 0: 64 1572 - 1 (climate change) 1: 65 397 - 1 (related to sustainability and water management) 1: 66 1158 - 1 (The text is about reducing CO2 emissions and monitoring progress toward targets, which is related to sustainability, the environment, and climate change.) 1: 67 532 - 0 0: 68 435 - 1 (climate change related) 1: 69 612 - 1 (climate change and sustainability related) 1: 70 716 - 1 (climate-related risks and opportunities mentioned) 1: \n","71 859 - 1 1: 72 507 - 0 0: 73 1032 - 1 (climate change and environment related) 1: 74 787 - 1 (sustainability and corporate socioenvironmental responsibility are mentioned) 1: 75 744 - 1 (climate change related) 1: 76 809 - 0 0: 77 1236 - 1 (ESG expertise and low-carbon economy transition) 1: 78 561 - 1 (sustainability) 1: 79 612 - 1 (climate change related) 1: 80 488 - 0 0: \n","81 552 - 1 (Environment related) 1: 82 422 - 1 (climate change) 1: 83 724 - 0 0: 84 491 - 1 (environmental/ sustainability related) 1: 85 1572 - 0 0: 86 701 - 1 (climate change) 1: 87 494 - 1 (sustainability) 1: 88 523 - 1 (sustainability and climate change related) 1: 89 939 - 0 0: 90 719 - 1 (climate change related) 1: \n","91 891 - 0 0: 92 551 - 1 (environment related) 1: 93 614 - 1 (environment related) 1: 94 601 - 1 (climate change related) 1: 95 530 - 1 (climate change related) 1: 96 532 - 1 (climate change related) 1: 97 1271 - 1 (environment and sustainability related) 1: error calling API, retrying...\n","error parsingAs a sustainability expert, I can see that AGL, the company mentioned in the text, is taking steps to address climate change by offering their customers an opportunity to offset their carbon emissions. The AGL Future Forests program provides a way for residential customers to offset the carbon emissions from their electricity consumption by purchasing native Australian forestry carbon credits. This is a positive step towards reducing carbon emissions, which is a key factor in the fight against climate change. Furthermore, the program also supports biodiversity conservation and the planting of Australian native trees, which is an additional positive outcome.

It acknowledges that banks have a crucial role to play in facilitating financing for sustainable projects and discouraging investments in projects that harm the environment and exacerbate climate change.\\n\\nThe text mentions the category of green bonds, which refers to financial instruments that are used to fund environmentally friendly projects. Green bonds have gained popularity in recent years as more investors look for sustainable investment options. Banks can play a key role in issuing green bonds and directing the proceeds towards sustainable projects.\\n\\nThe text also mentions the concept of 'no go projects', which means that banks have identified certain types of projects that they will not invest in. It specifically mentions two examples - Adani Carmichael coal mine and Keystone XL pipeline - which have been criticized for their negative impact on the environment and climate change.\\n\\nOverall, the text suggests that banks are increasingly aware of the need to adopt sustainable financing practices and are taking steps to align their lending and investment portfolios with environmental and social objectives. As a sustainability expert, I would encourage banks to further strengthen their ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies and practices to ensure that they contribute positively to sustainable development.\",\n"," '1 (Climate change and environment related)',\n"," '1 (Sustainability)',\n"," '1 (environment/sustainability/climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (environment related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (environment and climate change related)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change)',\n"," '1 (related to sustainability and water management)',\n"," '1 (The text is about reducing CO2 emissions and monitoring progress toward targets, which is related to sustainability, the environment, and climate change.)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (climate change and sustainability related)',\n"," '1 (climate-related risks and opportunities mentioned)',\n"," '1',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change and environment related)',\n"," '1 (sustainability and corporate socioenvironmental responsibility are mentioned)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (ESG expertise and low-carbon economy transition)',\n"," '1 (sustainability)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (Environment related)',\n"," '1 (climate change)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (environmental/ sustainability related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change)',\n"," '1 (sustainability)',\n"," '1 (sustainability and climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '0',\n"," '1 (environment related)',\n"," '1 (environment related)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (climate change related)',\n"," '1 (environment and sustainability related)',\n"," 'As a sustainability expert, I can see that AGL, the company mentioned in the text, is taking steps to address climate change by offering their customers an opportunity to offset their carbon emissions. The AGL Future Forests program provides a way for residential customers to offset the carbon emissions from their electricity consumption by purchasing native Australian forestry carbon credits. This is a positive step towards reducing carbon emissions, which is a key factor in the fight against climate change. Furthermore, the program also supports biodiversity conservation and the planting of Australian native trees, which is an additional positive outcome. The $1 per week cost is affordable for most households, meaning that it is accessible and inclusive. Additionally, the $1 per day electric vehicle charging offer further encourages sustainable mobility, which is a crucial component of carbon reduction and addressing climate change. Overall, AGL is taking positive steps towards sustainability and addressing climate change by offering these initiatives to their customers.',\n"," '1 (environment related)',\n"," \"As a sustainability, environment, and climate change expert, I can confirm that the information provided in the text is accurate and relevant to the discussion of limiting global warming. The scenarios developed by the IEA highlight the importance of policy interventions in shaping our energy markets and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Sustainable-Development Scenario is particularly important as it aligns with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting temperature rise to below 2°C, and with an even stronger aspirational target of limiting temperature rise to 1.5°C. This scenario also emphasizes the need for more sustainable development practices and technologies, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, as well as behavioral changes to support low-carbon lifestyles. Overall, it is important to recognize the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for immediate action to mitigate its impact.\",\n"," '1 (Environment-related)',\n"," '1 (sustainability
